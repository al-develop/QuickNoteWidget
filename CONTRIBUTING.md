# How is the source code structured?
I used WPF with MVVM. The MVVM Library in use is DevExpress.Mvvm (available in NuGet) The Metro Design of the Context Menus comes from MahApps.Metro (also available through NuGet) The Text Editor is from ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit (NuGet as well). By using AvalonEdit, we have build in options for LineNumbers and general "improvements". The WindowStyle is set to "None". To handle all the controlling (like closing, minimizing etc), I used the context menu (right click menu). There's also a TryIcon, which supports the same context menu commands as the Main UI. For moving the window around, I made the border a little bit wider with a light gray background. This is the Area which a user can click on, to drag the window around. If you plan to extend the context menu, notice that you got to extend the MainWindow context menu AND the TrayIcon context menu. Although this is a MVVM architecture, I have some code behind for UI specific stuff.
